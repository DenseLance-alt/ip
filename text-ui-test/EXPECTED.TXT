	My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in 
	the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, 
	and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu 
	department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the 
	latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed 
	by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no 
	matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing 
	about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I 
	usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like 
	a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the 
	morning. I was told there were no issues at my last 
	check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who 
	wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to 
	trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, 
	that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I 
	deal with society, and I know that is what brings me 
	happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to 
	anyone.

	What can I do for you?
